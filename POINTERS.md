## 1. Program to print the address of variables using the address operator.
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
        int a=3;
        float b=5.55;
        char c;

        printf("The addres of a is:%p\n",&a);
        printf("The address of b is:%p\n",&b);
        printf("The address of c is:%p\n",&c);


        return 0;
}
